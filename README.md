Elit - Image optimization helpers

What I changed

- Added a Node-based helper to convert existing JPG/PNG images in `img/` to WebP: `scripts/convert-webp.js` and `package.json`.
- Replaced inline `<img>` logo markup across multiple pages with a `<picture>` element that prefers `.webp` when available.
- Wrapped portfolio images in `index.html` with anchors `.lightbox-trigger` and `<picture>` so clicking opens the full-size original image in a minimal lightbox.
- Added `lightbox.css` and `lightbox.js` to provide a lightweight modal viewer (keyboard accessible: Esc, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight).

How to convert your images to WebP (Windows PowerShell)

1. Install Node.js if you don't have it: https://nodejs.org/
2. Open PowerShell in the project root (`c:\Users\Enes-PC\Desktop\Elit`).
3. Install dependencies:

   npm install

4. Run the converter:

   npm run convert-webp

This will create `.webp` files next to your existing images (e.g. `res2.webp`). The site uses the WebP files automatically via the `<picture>` tags, and falls back to the original JPG/PNG when WebP is not supported by the browser.

Notes & next steps

- The converter uses `sharp` and will overwrite existing `.webp` files with new versions.
- If you want to resize thumbnails to smaller sizes, we can extend the script to emit both thumbnails (e.g. `res2-thumb.webp`) and full-size webp files and switch the markup accordingly.
- If your hosting already serves WebP via server-side conversion or a CDN, you can drop the `scripts/` folder.

If you want, I can also:
- Generate thumbnail images and update the markup to use them for faster page load.
- Bulk compress existing JPG/PNG files to reduce disk space.

Generate thumbnails (recommended)

After converting to WebP you can also generate smaller thumbnails used on the portfolio grid. Run:

   npm run generate-thumbs

This creates `*-thumb.webp` images (e.g. `res2-thumb.webp`) in the `img/` folder. The site now uses these thumbnails for faster loading and the lightbox opens the full-size `.webp` when available.

Performance & Hosting recommendations (to address PageSpeed findings)

1) Preload the LCP image
   - Already applied: `index.html` now preloads `img/home.webp` with fetchpriority="high".

2) Serve resources with long cache lifetimes
   - Configure your web server or CDN to serve static assets (images, CSS, JS) with a long Cache-Control, for example:

     - For images, CSS, JS: Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800, immutable
     - For HTML: Cache-Control: no-cache (so you can update content while still caching other assets)

   - Example (NGINX):

     location ~* \.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|webp|avif|gif|svg)$ {
       add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=604800, immutable";
     }

     location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
       add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=604800, immutable";
     }

3) Defer non-critical CSS/JS
   - Lightbox CSS is loaded with `<link rel="preload" as="style" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'">` so it doesn't block LCP.
   - `lightbox.js` is loaded with `defer` to avoid blocking parsing.

4) Serve appropriately sized images for thumbnails
   - Thumbnails were generated at ~800px width. If PageSpeed suggests they should be smaller (e.g. 356Ã—267), consider regenerating thumbs at those exact dimensions (e.g. 400px width) and update the thumbnail generator `thumbWidth` constant in `scripts/generate-thumbs.js`.

5) Combine & minify CSS where possible
   - Consider minifying `style.css` and `nav.css` into a single `bundle.css` for fewer requests. Or serve gzipped/bripped versions via server.

6) Use a CDN
   - If you host images and static assets behind a CDN (Cloudflare, Fastly, S3+CloudFront), you get faster delivery and automatic caching rules.

If you want, I can:
 - Reduce thumbnail width to 400px and regenerate thumbs.
 - Provide a minified `bundle.css` and `bundle.js` (non-invasive) and update HTML to use them.
 - Provide exact server configuration snippets for Apache, Nginx, or a Cloudflare worker.
